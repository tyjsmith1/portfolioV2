There, I stepped into the shoes of a Product Manager II, a role that was both a challenge and a thrill from June 2019 to October 2023. In this arena, I championed a label-less inbounding program, cutting through the red tape to simplify shipping for our clients and boosting inbound volume by 30%. Leading agile teams, I was the maestro behind the curtain, orchestrating innovations that sang harmonies of efficiency and satisfaction."},

Here, I played a pivotal role in a logistical ballet, repositioning 30,000 leased assets for UPS's peak season with the finesse of a chess grandmaster, ensuring every piece was exactly where it needed to be."},
